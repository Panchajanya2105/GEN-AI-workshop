# GEN-AI-workshop
# Machine Learning and Image Processing Project

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning and image processing project. The project makes use of several popular Python packages, including TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCV, and others for data processing, model training, and inference.

The project also integrates with Google Colab for cloud-based execution and visualization, with additional support for language translation, speech generation, and computer vision tasks.
